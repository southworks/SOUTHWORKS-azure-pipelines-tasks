## Issues, Feature Request & Questions

### Writing Great Issues & Feature Requests

- Provide reproducible steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you expected to happen.
- Avoid listing multiple bugs or requests in the same issue. Always write a single bug or feature request per issue.

- Add screenshots or animated GIFs.

### Submit contribution

Pull Requests are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for projects. When we are writing them, we must think about, how the rest of the team is going to read it? What kind of information we will place in it to make it easy to read and understand its changes?. Follow these practices to help you to write great pull requests.

#### Writing great pull requests

- Choose a descriptive title and add the context of the changes using square brackets. 
  - e.g.: `[ApiCompat] Add a method`, `[GitHubPRComment] Add new comment format`
- If the pull request fixes an issue:
  - Use the issue's title as a name. 
    -  e.g.: ISSUE #03: `Pull Request Commenter triggers twice` ---> PR Title: `[ISSUE#03] Pull Request Commenter triggers twice`
  - Add the number of the related issue at the beginning, following the pull request template.
    -  e.g.: `Fixes #03` 
- Provide all the information about the changes made in the pull request.
- Add screenshots or animated GIFs.
